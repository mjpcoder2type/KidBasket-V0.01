This is the initial version of a program that collects the names of students for a teacher and places them in a text file
named STUDENTS.txt  As a text file isn't a server, the user would have to include each name in one session and then immediately
print out the file as anytime the process starts over completely the file is wiped.  This is completely command line at this time.
I am a novice programmer(about 3 months in) and I needed a project to get things going.  So don't expect amazing bells and whistles
at this time.  In the near future this will have a GUI and nice images to go along with it.
